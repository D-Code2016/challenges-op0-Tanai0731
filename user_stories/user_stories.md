# User Stories
User stories are written to describe how an app should look and feel from the user's point of view. They use a format of: "As a (type of user), I want (some function or prescription), so that (reason for function)".
As example if a school website wanted to create a calendar for students so students could see it and plan for off days, a user story might describe that as "As a student user, I want to see the school calendar, so that I can see what days we are out of school". User stories are used by developers to ensure they are developing the desired user experience.
